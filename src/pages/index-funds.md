Though Holm.School isn't necessarily a Financial Independence/Early Retirement blog (I myself am quite a newb to this, having only learned about Mr. Money Mustache early in 2017 thanks to Ryan Carson's great Educate Yourself podcast), I think it's impossible to focus on frugality in computer science education and not talk about what that frugality is for: optimally, early retirement or at least financial independence. If you are interested in financial independence, I suggest you take a week of your life and read every blog post at [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com). From there, explore more frugality blogs and books.

While rereading some articles last week, I noticed a link on one of his posts that I missed. It was [a series on index funds by jlcollinsnh](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/). While I had learned about index funds via Mr. Money Mustache, I had not understood that I could invest in index funds via my 403(b) retirement account I get for my job. It turns out, you can, and so last week I just started investing in them. I'm excited, and would like to share this blog series with you for your benefit. It's very helpful, daresay essential reading even if you don't implement his recommendations.

My favorite part of reading jlcollinsnh's series was [this episode by Frontline/PBS](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/retirement-gamble/).

Another good book to complement my Personal Finance readings I've been doing the past few months was "Pound Foolish" by Helaine Olen. She is featured in the Frontline episode, too!

Have a good weekend, all!
