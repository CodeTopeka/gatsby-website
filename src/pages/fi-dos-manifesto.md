title: "FI-DOS Manifesto: Financial Independence, Do Open Source"
ghissue: 95

I've been writing a lot of manifestos lately, and I decided there is one more to make. I call this one the "FI-DOS Manifesto," pronouce FIII-DAWS (as in MS-DOS).

It stands for "Financial Independence, Do Open Source." I can summarize it in just a few lines:

Be frugal and save in index funds wisely so that you can become financially independent early in life. Upon become FI, Do Open Source.

I think this is so instrumental to the FI computer science scene because the founding fathers of FI, notably Mr. Money Mustache and JL Collins, have both never paywalled their works (one an extensive blog, one a stock series). They are, by all means, "open source." You don't have to pay to read MMM, neither A Simple Path to Wealth.

I note this because the current trajectory of FI bloggers is to learn about FI, make a blog, appear on podcasts and hype your community, then sell publishing rights to a book. I don't understand why these books aren't open source, because the people that taught them what they needed to know -- MMM and JLCollins -- had their blogs open source.

People with the capacity to write a book and are FI need to publish their book as open source. It's silly to come out with a non-open source book when you're FI. Considering the forefathers of FIRE do it, perhaps you should consider doing it too.

It's even better for computer scientists: Once they FIRE, they can focus on open source software and projects.

The same goes for musicians and popular authors and other creatives: Once they're FI, they can release their albums and books as open source.

Maybe I'm on a heavy dose of hope, but why not open source your creations upon reaching FIRE? You could, *gasp*, even facilitate an open source community around your projects, tracking remixes and samplings and forks and derivative works. It could be fun, rather than just releasing another copyrighted CD or book to make a few more bucks even though you're plenty well off.

You could create OER. Teach kids how to do what you became an expert in with no copyright attached to the lessons. It could be used around the globe for free. You could share knowledge instead of attempting to monetize it. For the love of learning. Maybe what you're skilled at helps the globe, instead of hurting it.

Consider open source in your FIRE plans. I think copyrighted your works after FI is just sort of tacky and gauche. Everything in the future that is digital media is going to be open source anyway, all books and music and video tutorials and podcasts (podcasts are already practically open source, as is YouTube effectively). Why not be an early adopter and make your digital media open source? Personally I can't see any reason against it. Even if you are an entrepreneur. Just google "entrepreneur open source," it's quite possible and reasonable given the way technology is adopting.

Again, click on the "anti-copyright" label on the bottom of my page and read the Negativland essay. Anything with the explicit goal of contributing to the public domain is much more valuable to society than any monetary reward you can achieve by copyrighting your work. Pump in value instead of extracting it.

Contribute to the public domain. FI-DOS, don't just FIRE and start a copywritten blog/book/podcast. Scientists already are in their daily job and soon even entertainment and traditional media will too. The early adopters will be the ones that are still read/listened/watched in 1000 years.
