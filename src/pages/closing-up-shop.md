Holm School is turning one year old next month and I have to take a cold hard look at the fruits of my labor, and recognize the bitter truth that this endeavor is fruitless. Ultimately it seems no one reads my blog, as I have just about a hit a day it seems, and no one stays on the site for more than one minute. I don't even think I show up on google if I search "Holm School," haha. My github repos are not even viewed. Even though I thought my "Guide to Being a Not Rich Computer Scientist" would be useful due to my own personal success following the guidelines, it seems there wasn't much interest outside of myself. No one has commented on my blog, for example. That's the free market of ideas, I guess, and my product (even though free) has no takers. To continue on would be silly.

I think I don't need to evangelize for public libraries, I think they will take care of themselves just fine. I think people earning online bachelor's of science degrees in computer science through their public library is just a decade or so away. There are so many sources to study computer science at the public library, the blog posts about their advantages practically write themselves to anyone awake. So my need to proselytize for public libraries isn't necessary, since they will fill the niche for people who can't afford college quite effectively as computer science educational resources continue to plummet in price.

It's pretty exciting that learning computer science takes just a couple of hundreds of dollars these days. I am so optimistic about the future for computer scientists, as open source is finally affecting even education and public libraries. My thought that there could be a site for compiling the many advantages that open source edtech affords people learning computer science was misguided, as it seems no one really wants to read anything from anyone who promotes not going to college. People are breaking their backs trying to get into college, any college, at any cost, and the fervor for universities is potent in America. To think I would find an audience of Americans who didn't want to go to university was a tad naive. Even though I think going into debt at a young age, yes, even for education, is extremely foolish, I realize that is just part of adolescence in modern day America. Pointing out that these social requirements are exploitative isn't helping solve anything.

So I will go ahead and go dark, although I've leave the website up for reference. I will probably spend my free time self educating about science and math. As a liberal arts major, I missed out of a university science education and it feels imperative to correct that oversight. I can also use my free time to keep studying computer science and increase my proficiency in my company's stack. I am probably more useful to the world as a computer scientist than an open source edtech activist. I think the computer science community will address the problems related to computer science education just fine without my input. My focus is better served elsewhere.

Thank you for reading this blog if you happened to stumble across it.
