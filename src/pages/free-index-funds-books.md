I made a repository on github that contains a catalog of free books on index funds available on the internet.

You can visit the repository here: https://github.com/HolmSchool/free-index-funds-books

Below is a copy of the listing in its current state in May 2019. Please note, this will quickly become out of date, so visit the most up to date catalog at https://github.com/HolmSchool/free-index-funds-books.
