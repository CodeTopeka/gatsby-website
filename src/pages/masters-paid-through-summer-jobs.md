title: "A Master's Degree in Computer Science Paid For Through Summer Jobs"
---

Here's my four-year online curriculum for potential computer science students who want to earn a bachelor's and even a master's degree.

The separate cost is $1200 for Treehouse, $4000 for UofPeople, and $800 for PluralSight (each for four years). Internet will be $2160. The total cost is $8160, or $170 a month.

First off you should use UofPeople for the bachelor's degree. Combine that with this site's listing of OER books for each subject you study, and you will be able to get a good CS education. You will have to work above and beyond the minimum course requirement, and study books that aren't assigned. This will speed up your progress, however, and classes will become easier. The more effort you pump into early progress by working 100% of your free hours on computer science, the sooner you can delve into more interesting CS subjects like AI (where the jobs are too).

At the same time that you're studying UofPeople and also the OER curriculum listed here on this site, you should also study at Treehouse. Treehouse is expensive at $25 a month, and the courses don't usually cover computer science topics but instead web development. If you are interested in web development (or the languages offered at Treehouse), you should subscribe at the same time you're working on your UofPeople degree. You'll learn practical skills that can be used in a job. Try to get 100% completion of Treehouse's curriculum in the four years you're paying for it.

PluralSight will help you learn more corporation-friendly programming. Here you can learn Microsoft's stack, etc., that can help you learn job-friendly skills. There are also good business classes and professional development tracks ("Upgrading Your Technology Career"). You can really supplement your CS learning by PluralSight courses. For example, the CCNA courses are great for learning networking principles.

The total cost of $6000 can be paid off working two summers at minimum wage. You could also work a 5 hours a week to absorb the cost of the subscriptions and UofPeople.

At the end of the four years, when you have a bachelor's degree from UofPeople and know 10+ programming languages and frameworks, and so forth, you'll be able to get a junior programming job.

When your job has tuition reimbursement, sign up for Georgia Tech's OMSCS graduate degree in the field of your interest (AI, ML, Robotics, or Systems). This will cost $7000 but will be at least halved and possibly quartered by your job's tuition reimbursement benefit. This program is for working adults. You'll have to work your butt off, but you can come out in two or three years with a graduate degree in CS. With my work's benefits, this graduate degree would cost $2400 total!

All this can be supplemented through OER, the public library's CS stack, your local university library's CS stacks, and online video subscription services provided by your public library like Lynda.com (some public libraries even provide Treehouse subscriptions). The more CS books you read in your four years of study, the more you'll be prepared for a job. Read read read!

So, all in all, you can get a master's degree in CS for something around $13,000 (including internet fees). Not too shabby! Given that this is six years in duration, you could pay for it through summer jobs. And after six years of study, you'll be pretty darn good at programming!

Work your butt off and study CS online!

Final note: You can probably learn just as much using OER and your public library using the curriculum provided here on this website, and do all of this studying for free! Personally I would just rather work a bit and pay up the $12,000 dollars to earn a master's degree, but if that option is off the table for you, know that you don't have to subscribe to these online educational websites and can instead learn for free through OER and your public library. As soon as you get a first job you can start your tuition reimbursement benefits and make it up. Nothing is wrong with relying on OER and your public library, it's a very sensible and frugal choice.

In summary (six years in duration):

For four years:

University of the People B.S. in CS

Treehouse

PluralSight

Internet/Raspberry Pi

For two years:

Georgia Tech's OMSCS M.S. in CS (tuition reimbursement through a job)

Internet/Raspberry Pi

As low as $13,000 total
