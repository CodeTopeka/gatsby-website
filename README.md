# contributing a new blog post

Make a Pull Request with a markdown file in the ```/pages``` folder with its file name being the title of your post (your-file-name.md will become the url at codetopeka.org/your-file-name). You will need to copy and paste then change the markdown headers from another blogpost markdown in the /pages folder. You can change the date to the date of your post, change the title to your full title in normal English, and then change the issue # to an issue that you create under the issues tab here. Just make a new issue then link to your blog post's url for easy reference. Then whoever posts on that issue will have their comment posted below the blogpost. This is kind of a lot of overhead, but since it's a static site comments aren't really supported and it's just a hacky way to turn the github API into a commenting system.
